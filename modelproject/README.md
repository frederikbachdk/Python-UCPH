# Model project

Our project is titled **Markowitz' Portfolio Selection & Extensions** which is a static model of an investor seeking to maximize expected risk-weighted returns given a known distribution of returns and a given degree of risk aversion.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [Model project.ipynb](Model project.ipynb).

This project **does not load any datasets**, but works with the **Yahoo! Finance API** in order to get historical return data from the Dow Jones Index. 

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires the following installations:

``!pip install pandas-datareader``
``!pip install scipy``
``!pip install pandas``
``!pip install pipywidgets``
``!pip install datetime``

Have fun with optimizing your portfolio of Dow Jones stocks!
