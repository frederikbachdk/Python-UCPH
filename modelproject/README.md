# Data analysis project

Our project is titled **Danish Labour hoarding during Covid-19** and seeks to answer to which degree labour hoarding was present on the Danish labour market during the first Covid-19 in 2020. The analysis investigates gross unemployment in different industries and compares the development of these, in combination with the development in Covid-19.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [dataproject.ipynb](dataproject.ipynb).

This **does not load any datasets**, rather it works with the **Statistics Denmark API** in order to get data from the AUF02 and SMIT1 tables.

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires the following installations:

``!pip install pandas-datareader``
``!pip install git+https://github.com/elben10/pydst``
