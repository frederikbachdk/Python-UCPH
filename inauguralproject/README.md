# Inaugural project
This project is a very simplified emulation of the tax reform that will be implemented
in Denmark in 2024. The project includes functions to estimate and optimize household utility functions, aggregate and average tax payments, and methods to optimize policy parameters.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [inauguralproject.ipynb](inauguralproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
